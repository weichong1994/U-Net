# U-Net
Implement U-Net using pytorch trained with carvana-image-masking-challenge.

First 4000 image from Kaggle carvana-image-masking-challenge train dataset is used to train U-Net.

The next 1088 images from Kaggle carvana-image-masking-challenge train dataset is used to test the model with IoU score.
